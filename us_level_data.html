				<h1>2012-2016 MANUFACTURING TOTALS</h1>
				<div id="vizContainer7" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>This bubble chart offers us a great initial snapshot of how the manufacturing sector has changed from 2012 to 2016. Firstly, we can see that
				from 2012-2014, both receipts and costs were steadily increasing, before drastic drops in 2015. Since then, the decline has continued into 2016. Employment, which is expressed
				through the size of each bubble, has remained relatively flat, decreasing from 11.2 million to 11.1 million over five years. Perhaps most interestingly, despite the other key variables
				dropping, payroll has soared, indicated through the color of each bubble. The statistics for each year can be seen by simply hovering over each bubble in the visualization. </p>
				
				<h1>MANUFACTURING SUBSECTOR VISUALIZATIONS</h1>
				<h2>2012-2016 Subsector Area Chart</h2>
				<div id="vizContainer2" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>The above area chart displays 3-digit NAICS Codes within the manufacturing sector. By adjusting the filters, we can see the dominate subsectors in the country for 
				receipts, costs, payroll, and employment. In addition to viewing all subsectors at once, the NAICS filters were also added if statistics for a single NAICS are needed.Transportation,
				Chemical, and Food Manufacturing have a consistently large presence. Also, interestingly if we filter to look at employees, we can see a more even spread amongst NAICS Codes.</p>
				
				<h2>2012-2016 Subsector Difference Comparison</h2>
				<div id="vizContainer3" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>This bar chart shows the absolute differences for our variables over the past 5 years of available data. NAICS 336, Transportation Equipment 
				Manufacturing, has solid increases across the board, indicating growth. Meanwhile, Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing has significant losses in receipts. Looking at payroll, we can 
				see that in many subsectors, employees are being compensated better than they were in 2012, especially the ones in which employees decreased but payroll increased (such as NAICS 332).</p>
				
				<h2>2012-2016 Subsector Percent Change Comparison</h2>
				<div id="vizContainer4" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>This bar chart is laid out similarly, but compares the percent changes over 5 years instead. Wood product manufacturing had noteworthy increases that were not as visible 
				in the earlier view. The same could be said for NAICS 312, but only for annual payroll and number of employees. Lastly, apparel manufacturing had significant decreases across the board
				from a percent change perspective.</p>
				
				<h2>2016 Subsector Bubble Chart</h2>
				<div id="vizContainer" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>This unique visualization allows us to collectively view all four variables at once for the year 2016. The x-axis denotes receipts while the y-axis shows costs. The color of each bubble is 
				determined by the subsectors annual payroll, and lastly the size of the bubble indicates the number of employees. Petroluem and coal products manufacturing is an interesting outlier, as its
				value of shipments and cost of materials are fairly high, while its payroll and employees are significantly low.</p>
				
				<h1>MANUFACTURING NATIONAL INDUSTRY VISUALIZATIONS</h1>
				
				<h2>Top 10 Industries (2016)</h2>
				<div id="vizContainer5" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>Top 3 Receipts: Petroleum refineries, Light truck and utility vehicle mfg, Pharmaceutical preparation mfg</p>
				<p>Top 3 Cost of Materials: Petroleum refineries, Light truck and utility vehicle mfg, Automobile mfg</p>
				<p>Top 3 Payroll: Commercial printing (except screen and books), All other plastics product mfg, Aircraft mfg</p>
				<p>Top 3 Number of Employees: All other plastics product mfg, Commercial printing (except screen and books), Poultry processing</p>
				
				<h2>Bottom 10 Industries (2016)</h2>
				<div id="vizContainer6" style="width:825px; height:400px;"></div>
				<p>Bottom 3 Receipts: Other apparel knitting mills, Women's handbag and purse mfg, Blank magnetic and optical recording media mfg</p>
				<p>Bottom 3 Cost of Materials: Other apparel knitting mills, Women's handbag and purse mfg, Ice mfg</p>
				<p>Bottom 3 Payroll: Blank magnetic and optical recording media mfg, Women's handbag and purse mfg, Other apparel knitting mills</p>
				<p>Bottom 3 Number of Employees: Blank magnetic and optical recording media mfg, Malt mfg, Women's handbag and purse mfg</p>
